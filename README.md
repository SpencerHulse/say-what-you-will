## Description

From front-end to back-end, all the coding was done by me. It is the first time I have built anything from the ground up that includes everything. There is definitely room to grow, but I am happy with it. The basic premise of the site is a blog site, where people can create accounts, make posts, and comment on their posts and others.

The project utilizes npm packages bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize.

The code also follows the MVC framework.
